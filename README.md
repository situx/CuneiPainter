CuneiPainter enables you to paint cuneiform characters using your fingers on the touchscreen of your smartphone.
The app recognizes the four stroke types of cuneiform as defined by the [Gottstein System](http://cdli.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/pubs/cdln/php/single.php?id=000070):
* left to right (A)
* up to down (B)
* down right to up left (C)
* down left to up right (D)

Wedges are recognized as class C and not as class E as also suggested by Gottstein.

This app uses the Akkadian font by [Andrea Vianello](www.bronzeage.org.uk/ancient-fonts.aspx) as provided in the Open Source package [ttf-ancient-fonts](https://packages.debian.org/sid/ttf-ancient-fonts)
